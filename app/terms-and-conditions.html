            <p><strong>THE HAWK GAMES LTD (Company No. 16601168)</strong><br>
            Registered office: 9 The Bridges, Spohr Terrace, South Shields, NE33 3LT, United Kingdom<br>
            Incorporated on 23 July 2025<br>
            <strong>Last updated:</strong> 15 August 2025</p>

            <h2>1. About Us</h2>
            <p>The promoter of all prize promotions operated under the The Hawk Games brand is THE HAWK GAMES LTD (“Promoter”, “we”, “us”, “our”), company number 16601168, registered office at 9 The Bridges, Spohr Terrace, South Shields, NE33 3LT, United Kingdom.</p>

            <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competition</strong>: Any prize draw, skill-based competition, instant win or other promotion run by us.</li>
                <li><strong>Website</strong>: Any site or app we operate for the Competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Entry</strong>: A valid participation submitted via the online paid route or the Free Entry Route.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotion Period</strong>: The period stated on the relevant Competition page.</li>
                <li><strong>Ticket Number</strong>: The unique number allocated to an Entry.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The Competitions are open only to natural persons aged 18 years or over who are legally resident in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). Residents of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are excluded. You must not enter on behalf of any other person.</li>
                <li>Employees, contractors and agents of the Promoter, and members of their immediate households, are not eligible to enter.</li>
                <li>We may require age and identity verification before awarding any prize and may void Entries where adequate verification is not provided within the timeframe we specify.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>4. How to Enter</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Online Paid Route</strong>: follow the instructions on the Competition page to purchase Entries. Pricing, maximum number of Entries per person, prize details and closing date/time are displayed on each Competition page.</li>
                <li><strong>Free Entry Route</strong>: you may enter any Competition without paying by post (first or second class only). See the Free Entry Route terms supplied alongside these Terms; the Free Entry Route is treated equally to paid entries.</li>
                <li>Each Competition may set a cap on total Entries and/or Entries per person. Once sold out or once the Promotion Period ends (whichever is earlier), no further Entries will be accepted.</li>
                <li>Incomplete, illegible, bulk or automated Entries, or Entries that do not comply with these Terms, are void.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>5. Skill Questions & Instant Wins</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Where a Competition is a skill competition, you must correctly answer a qualifying question or complete a task of skill, judgement or knowledge to enter. We may disqualify Entries which indicate that the skill requirement has not been met.</li>
                <li>For instant win mechanics, winning Ticket Numbers are pre-allocated before launch and disclosed only after the Entry is made. If your Ticket Number matches a pre-allocated winning number, you win the corresponding prize instantly. Instant win allocations do not distinguish between paid or Free Entry Route Entries.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>6. Allocation of Ticket Numbers</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Ticket Numbers are generated and allocated at the point of Entry. Where applicable, a publicly verifiable random number generator and tamper‑evident logs are used. Your Ticket Numbers will be visible in your account area or supplied by email for postal Entries.</li>
                <li>For transparency, we may publish non‑identifying entry list data (e.g., ranges of numbers allocated).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>7. Draws and Winner Selection</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Where a Competition uses a draw, the winner(s) will be selected at random from all valid Entries using a random number generator or a supervised draw procedure. Draws will occur on or shortly after the closing date shown on the Competition page.</li>
                <li>Winners will be notified by email/SMS and may be announced on our Website and social channels. If a winner does not respond within 7 days, we reserve the right to re‑draw or to award the prize to a reserve entry.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>8. Publication of Winners</h2>
            <p>We will either publish, or make available on request, information indicating that a valid award took place – ordinarily the winner’s surname and county (and, if applicable, the winning Entry). Entrants are informed of this requirement at entry and may object or request a reduction in the information published; in such case we will still provide evidence of a valid award to the Advertising Standards Authority if challenged.</p>

            <h2>9. Prizes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prizes are as described on the Competition page. Images are for illustrative purposes only. Where a cash alternative is offered, the value will be specified on the Competition page and may be substituted at our discretion where the original prize is unavailable.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle prizes</strong>: unless stated otherwise, vehicles are UK models with standard specification, and may be pre‑owned. Road tax, insurance, fuel, collection/delivery, maintenance, and any optional extras are the winner’s responsibility unless stated otherwise.</li>
                <li>We may substitute a prize of equal or higher value if necessary due to circumstances beyond our control.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>10. Promotional Offers & Credits</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>We may issue discount codes, multi‑buy offers or account credits. Such promotions are subject to any specific terms stated at issue and may be withdrawn or amended where permitted by the CAP Code.</li>
                <li>Discount codes and credits have no cash value, are non‑transferable and cannot be withdrawn.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>11. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Entries are final and non‑refundable once confirmed. If we cancel a Competition or make a material error that affects fairness, we will refund the affected Entries to the original payment method or as account credit.</li>
                <li>Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>12. Fair Play, Fraud & Account Use</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>You must not create multiple accounts, use automated scripts/bots, or otherwise attempt to circumvent our systems. We may void affected Entries and close accounts for suspected abuse or fraud.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to withhold or reclaim a prize where we reasonably suspect breach of these Terms, fraud, or unlawful conduct, and to report matters to the relevant authorities.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>13. Liability</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>We do not exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or other liability that cannot be excluded by law.</li>
                <li>Subject to the above, we are not liable for: (a) losses not caused by our breach; (b) business losses and loss of profit; (c) failures beyond our reasonable control, including outages or third‑party platform issues.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>14. Changes to a Promotion</h2>
            <p>We will only exceptionally supplement or amend conditions of entry during a promotion. If changes are required (e.g., for legal or safety reasons), we will communicate how to obtain the updated rules. No change will materially disadvantage entrants who have already entered unless required by law or regulators.</p>

            <h2>15. Complaints & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>If you have a complaint, please contact us using the details below. We aim to resolve issues promptly and fairly. If we cannot resolve your complaint, you may seek advice from Citizens Advice or refer to an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) body.</p>

            <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
