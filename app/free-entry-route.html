            <h1>Free Entry Route (Postal) — Policy & Instructions</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 15 August 2025</p>
            
            <h2>Equal treatment & legal context</h2>
            <p>A free entry route is offered alongside paid online entry. Postal entries are free other than the cost of standard first‑ or second‑class postage. Postal entries are given the same chances per entry as paid entries and are included in all draws and instant‑win allocations. We advertise the free route with equal prominence wherever we advertise paid entry.</p>

            <h2>How to enter by post</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>On a plain postcard or letter, <strong>handwrite</strong> the following:
                    <ul>
                       <li>Competition name exactly as shown</li>
                       <li>Your full name and postal address</li>
                       <li>Email address and mobile number</li>
                       <li>Date of birth (confirming you are 18+)</li>
                       <li>Your answer to any skill question (if applicable)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Send by <strong>FIRST or SECOND CLASS</strong> post only to:
                    <address>
                        <strong>FREE ENTRY, THE HAWK GAMES LTD</strong><br>
                        9 The Bridges, Spohr Terrace<br>
                        South Shields, NE33 3LT<br>
                        United Kingdom
                    </address>
                    <p>Do <strong>not</strong> send by recorded, special delivery or courier; such entries may be refused.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>One Entry per stamped outer envelope.</strong> If the Competition allows multiple Entries per person, you may submit multiple envelopes up to that limit.</li>
                <li>Postal Entries must be <strong>received</strong> by us before the Competition closing date/time shown on the Competition page.</li>
                <li>We will allocate your Ticket Number(s) on receipt and confirmation will be emailed or sent by SMS. If you do not have an online account, we may create one for you so you can view Entry details.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Fairness, limits & duplication</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Postal Entries are subject to the same <strong>per‑person limits</strong> as paid entries for the relevant Competition.</li>
                <li>Illegible, incomplete or bulk/automated postal Entries are void.</li>
                <li>We may reject multiple Entries that appear to be made to circumvent per‑person limits (e.g., name variations at the same address).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><!-- LIABILITY: This section has been rewritten -->Instant Wins & Bonus Spin Tokens</h2>
            <p>For Competitions that award bonus Spin Tokens, postal entries participate on exactly the same terms as paid entries. If the Competition you are entering by post is designated as an "Instant Win" competition, your successfully processed postal entry will be awarded the same number of Spin Tokens as an equivalent paid entry. These tokens can then be used in our Instant Win spinner game.</p>

            <h2>Data protection</h2>
            <p>We process your personal data to administer the Competition and to contact you about your Entry. See our Privacy Policy for details. We do not require you to purchase anything to enter via post.</p>

            <h2>Returns & confirmation</h2>
            <p>We do not return postal materials. Proof of posting is not proof of receipt. Confirmation of your Entry will be sent once processed.</p>
